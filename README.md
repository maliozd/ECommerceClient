# E-Commerce Client

This repository contains the **frontend client** of an e-commerce application.

The project was developed as a **learning-oriented frontend companion** to the backend API, focusing on consuming a modern ASP.NET Core–based e-commerce service.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project was to:

- Practice real-world frontend–backend integration
- Consume secured APIs (JWT-based authentication)
- Understand client-side responsibilities in a layered backend architecture
- Progress through experimentation rather than perfection

This project was built alongside an educational backend journey guided by **Gençay Yıldız**.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- API consumption via HTTP
- JWT-based authentication flow
- SignalR (where applicable)
- Simple and framework-light frontend structure


## 📌 Notes

- This is a **learning-focused frontend project**
- Designed to work with the corresponding E-Commerce API
- Prioritizes clarity and understanding over visual complexity
